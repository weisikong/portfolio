      $("#article").append("<p>For people from my former circle, and basically from many other professions outside the tech circle itself, the word \"developer\" has too long been associated with geeks whose only interest is computer-related stuff, who suck at physical activities and are a total disaster when it comes to socializing. They seem less \"human\" than all other professions. A degree of awkwardness is expected.</p><p>How about when the tech people think about lawyers? Well, the stereotype is as long-standing. He/she wears a dark suit, carries a briefcase, argues extensively with fancy legal terms, and sees a legal case in every possible life scenario. Bloated with self-confidence and loads of money, the lawyer is always a symbol of the elite class.</p><p>Of course, stereotypes often go to extreme ends, but they serve well to identify what most people think.</p><p>I never met a programmer in real life who meets the descriptions in the stereotype. Have you? The real-life IT guys often defy the stereotype. It is not a rare case when you bump into a developer who exercises, has some tan, and is as outgoing as starting a conversation with you on the subway. I often wonder to myself, where do these stereotypes come from? Because every instructor/advisor in our ICT department keeps talking about how employers will expect students from this department to be introvert.</p><p>The lawyer picture is just as partial. Going to trial is not a common part of every lawyer’s daily routine, so they don’t wear suits every day. I was frightened when I was at law school, surrounded by belief that lawyers should be loud and aggressive, because I’m not at all that. After years I am convinced that being pushy is not a necessary quality of a lawyer. On the contrary, being reserved and careful about what you say will more likely go the long way. For example, attaching conditions to sentences is a common way of lawyer talking.</p><p>I often see lawyers wanting to live up to the traditional expectations of a warrior, refrain from showcasing their personality – their funny side. Something I don’t see programmers do.</p><p>Enough about the stereotypes.</p><p>One thing I find people often overlook in lawyers, is that they think logically. It is encompassed in everything they say and do. It is the core in their skillsets. To do this, you often need to eliminate emotions from the equation. That is probably why they get reputation as being sharks. Sometimes you need to go a little bit sociopathic to get the job done.</p><p>Guess what programmers rely on? Logics!</p><p>From Day 1 of programming, every programmer needs to know about the semantic implications of \"if\", \"then\" and so on. Otherwise, you simply cannot proceed. Eventually you’ll get deeper understanding of it and know by heart that, logic rules. For example, the best thing I learned is that machines can’t make mistakes. They follow strict logics. This limitation becomes a golden guideline: no matter how uncanny a bug seems, there is always a human mistake there; if you keep on cracking at it, you’ll eventually crack it.</p><p>I would argue that logic is the religion of both lawyers and programmers.</p><p>To say that this is the only important matter to both professions would be over-simplifying. There are more types of lawyers and programmers than I can discuss here, and each have their own heavy-lifting skills other than logic. But in the end, they both need to follow strict logic; they need to become deep thinkers; they need to have an organized mind.</p><p>That, is why I think they are not that different.</p><p>The world is more about diversity now. I think it might be interested in having a quirky, personality-showing, article-writing, big-word using developer.</p>");

Seriously, where do these stereotypes come from? And how come even my ICT instructors/advisors kept talking about them?</p><p>As for the lawyers, they don't wear suits unless when it's a big day. Going to trials is not a common part of their daily routine. There are some lawyers who are more agressive and argumentative, but not all feature that. Being extrovert and socialable isn't a necessary quality for a lawyer. I would argue that being reserved and careful about what you say is more likely a lawyer characteristic; conditions are often added to their sentences. And because the whole profession is a conservative one, many don't tend to show their funny side.</p><p>One thing that I find people often neglect about lawyers, is that they think logically. They hone their skills of logical thinking every day. It is emcompassed in everything they say and do. You often need to eliminate emotions from the equation and follow pure logic. That is probably why they get reputation as being sharks. A lawyer's job is not to empathize. A bit of sociopathical qualities is good for what they do.</p><p>This cold-blooded objectiveness and the worship of logic is what actually aligns with a programmer's qualities. As I learned to program, the best thing I learned is that machines don't make mistakes. They are made of cold logics. There is no wiggle room there. </p><p>So the biggest common theme of a lawyer and a programmer's job is that they both need to follow strict logic. There are more nuances to it, as there are more types of lawyers and programmers than I can summerize here, and what logic means to them is not always the same. But you get the general idea, these two professions are not too far apart.</p><p>Here comes also a difference between the two professions, and I think that is why I chose one over another. Lawyers spent their lives living inside the boxes that laws and rules made for them. Sometimes they try to pry open a wiggle room inside the brick of logic, using the illusions of human languages. They dance with cuffs and that is an art.</p><p>But the greatest theme of art is creation. To programmers, the logics are tools to build new creations with. </p>");
