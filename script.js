They seem less \"human\" than all other professions. A degree of awkwardness is expected.</p><p>How about when the tech people think about lawyers? Well, the stereotype is as long-standing. He/she wears a dark suit, carries a briefcase, argues extensively with fancy legal terms, and sees a legal case in every possible life scenario. Bloated with self-confidence and loads of money, the lawyer is always a symbol of the elite class.</p><p>Of course, stereotypes often go to extreme ends, but they serve well to identify what most people think.</p><p>I never met a programmer in real life who meets the descriptions in the stereotype. Have you? The real-life IT guys often defy the stereotype. It is not a rare case when you bump into a developer who exercises, has some tan, and is as outgoing as starting a conversation with you on the subway. I often wonder to myself, where do these stereotypes come from? Because every instructor/advisor in our ICT department keeps talking about how employers will expect students from this department to be introvert.</p><p>The lawyer picture is just as partial. Going to trial is not a common part of every lawyer’s daily routine, so they don’t wear suits every day. I was frightened when I was at law school, surrounded by belief that lawyers should be loud and aggressive, because I’m not at all that. After years I am convinced that being pushy is not a necessary quality of a lawyer. On the contrary, being reserved and careful about what you say will more likely go the long way. For example, attaching conditions to sentences is a common way of lawyer talking.</p><p>I often see lawyers wanting to live up to the traditional expectations of a warrior, refrain from showcasing their personality – their funny side. Something I don’t see programmers do.</p><p>Enough about the stereotypes.</p><p>One thing I find people often overlook in lawyers, is that they think logically. It is encompassed in everything they say and do. It is the core in their skillsets. To do this, you often need to eliminate emotions from the equation. That is probably why they get reputation as being sharks. Sometimes you need to go a little bit sociopathic to get the job done.</p><p>Guess what programmers rely on? Logics!</p><p>From Day 1 of programming, every programmer needs to know about the semantic implications of \"if\", \"then\" and so on. Otherwise, you simply cannot proceed. Eventually you’ll get deeper understanding of it and know by heart that, logic rules. For example, the best thing I learned is that machines can’t make mistakes. They follow strict logics. This limitation becomes a golden guideline: no matter how uncanny a bug seems, there is always a human mistake there; if you keep on cracking at it, you’ll eventually crack it.</p><p>I would argue that logic is the religion of both lawyers and programmers.</p><p>To say that this is the only important matter to both professions would be over-simplifying. There are more types of lawyers and programmers than I can discuss here, and each have their own heavy-lifting skills other than logic. But in the end, they both need to follow strict logic; they need to become deep thinkers; they need to have an organized mind.</p><p>That, is why I think they are not that different.</p><p>The world is more about diversity now. I think it might be interested in having a quirky, personality-showing, article-writing, big-word using developer.</p>");
