The word \"developer\" has too long been associated with pale geeks whose only interest is computer-related stuff, who suck at physical activities and are a total disaster when it comes to socializing. The lawyer is the traditional image of success and arguably greediness: wears a dark suit, carries a briefcase, argues extensively with fancy legal terms, and sees a legal case in every possible life scenario, bloated with self-confidence and loads of money.</p><p>I never met a programmer in real life who meets the descriptions in most people’s heads. Have you? The real-life IT guys often defy the stereotype. He/she can often be as outgoing as starting a conversation with you on the subway. </p><p>The lawyer picture is just as partial. I was frightened when I was at law school, surrounded by beliefs that lawyers should be loud and aggressive, because I’m not at all that. After years I am convinced that being pushy is not a necessary quality of a lawyer. On the contrary, being reserved and careful about what you say is more likely to serve you the long term.</p><p>When I first enrolled in school for programming, I found it rather instinctive. Everything to me was natural. Then I realized that years of training in law wasn't a complete waste. The similarity between these two lines of professions is more obvious than people think.</p><p>One thing I find people often overlook in lawyers, is that they think logically. It is encompassed in everything they say and do. It is the core in their skillsets. To do this, you often need to eliminate emotions from the equation. They often need to get a little sociopathic to get the job done.</p><p>Guess what programmers rely on?</p><p>From Day 1 of programming, every programmer needs to know about the semantic implications of \"if\", \"then\" and so on. Otherwise, you simply cannot proceed. Eventually you’ll get deeper understanding of it and know by heart that, logic rules. Arguably, the best thing I learned is that machines can’t make mistakes. They follow strict logics. This limitation becomes a golden guideline: no matter how uncanny a bug seems, there is always a human mistake there; if you keep on cracking at it, you’ll eventually crack it.</p><p>This religion of logics is no different than in the lawyering world. It makes me very happy as an INTP.</p><p>I know this is simplifying. There are more types of lawyers and programmers than I can discuss here, and each have their own heavy-lifting skills other than logic; but that is enough to explain why I am here.</p><p>The world is more about diversity now. I think it might be interested in having a quirky, personality-showing, article-writing, big-word using developer.</p>");
